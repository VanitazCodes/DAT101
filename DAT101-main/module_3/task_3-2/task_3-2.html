      <li><b>In part 1, is it possible to solve the problem using a single "for" loop?</b>
        
        <p> Yes, it's possible to achieve similar functionality with a single loop by concatenating both ascending and descending numbers into a single string. 
            For example, you can use the loop to build the string for both directions by checking if the index is less than or greater than a certain midpoint.</p>
      </li>
      <li><b>In part 2, can we create what is known as an "infinite" loop within the condition of the "while" loop? Describe what would or would not be necessary to achieve this. 
             Provide a thorough explanation of</b>

        <p>Yes, you can create an infinite loop by using a condition that never becomes false. In your code, if guessedNumber is never set to targetNumber, 
           the loop will continue indefinitely. To avoid this, ensure there's a way for the condition to eventually be satisfied.</p>
      </li>
      <li><b>Discuss briefly how quickly or slowly a computer might be able to compute this, considering the number of guesses and the time it takes. 
             How does the program behave while it is guessing? Can the program perform other tasks concurrently?</b>
        
        <p>The time it takes for the computer to compute the solution depends on how quickly it can generate random numbers and how close the targetNumber is to the generated guesses. 
           The program is busy executing the loop and does not perform other tasks concurrently unless using you're multithreading (which most people are these days)</p>
      </li>
      <li><b>Explain the relationship between rows and columns in nested "for" loops. Can we, for instance, change the order, 
             considering rows to be innermost or columns to be innermost, or does this not matter?</b>

        <p>In nested loops, the order matters for how the loops execute. If rows are innermost, the inner loop completes all iterations for the row before moving to the next row. 
           Switching the order will change the output, as each loop's behavior is dependent on its nesting.</p>
