      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 1, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>When wake up time is 7 and the condition is true. It prints that you can take the bus, however if the condition is not met then you're taking the train or car</p>
      <li>Same as question #1. How ever the answer should now be different. Discuss the behavior of part 2, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>As stated previously if you can't wake up at 7 o'clock, then you can take a train at 8 o'clock, otherwise you gotta take the car</p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 3, what happens when wake time is less than 7 or greater than 8?</li>
      <p>As previously stated, if you wake up in less than 7 then you can take the bus, but if greater than 8 you gotta take the car sadly. </p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior for part 4, what happens if the number is exactly 0, is zero positive or negative?</li>
      <p>In this part, the code evaluates a number. If the number is exactly 0, it prints "Zero" if its greater than 0 it's positive and if lesser than 0 it goes into negatives. </p>
