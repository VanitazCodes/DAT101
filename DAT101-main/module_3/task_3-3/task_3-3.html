      <li><b>What is the difference between invoking and creating a function?</b></li>
      <p>Creating a function is when you write it out, basically setting it up with what it should do. Invoking a function is when you actually use it to do its job.</p>
    
      <li><b>Explain the syntax regarding semicolons and code blocks.</b></li>
      <p>In JavaScript, semicolons end a line of code (but they're sometimes optional). Code blocks are the parts wrapped in `{ }` 
        brackets, and they hold all the instructions for things like functions and loops.</p>
    
      <li><b>What happens when we try to store values from a function when it doesn't return any?</b></li>
      <p>If a function doesn't return anything, trying to store its result will just give you `undefined`, which means there's no value.</p>
    
      <li><b>How do we separate parameters from each other when creating a function?</b></li>
      <p>We separate parameters by putting commas between them inside the parentheses when writing the function. For example: `function example(param1, param2) { }`.</p>
    
      <li><b>Explain how parameter names are related during the invocation and creation of a function.</b></li>
      <p>When you create a function, parameter names are placeholders. When you use (or "invoke") the function, these placeholders get replaced with the actual values you pass in.</p>
    
      <li><b>Explain why a parameter is undefined when a function call is missing a parameter.</b></li>
      <p>If a function call is missing a parameter, JavaScript just leaves that spot as `undefined` because no value was given for it.</p>
    
      <li><b>Explain what happens when we use recursive functions.</b></li>
      <p>A recursive function is a function that calls itself. Each time it calls itself, it gets closer to a stopping point, which is called the base case. 
        If there's no base case or if it never gets there, it could keep going forever and crash.</p>
