      <li><strong>Where should you use constants, and where should you use variables? Can they all be constants?</strong></li>
      <p>
				Constants should be used for values that are not expected to change throughout the execution of a program.
			</p>
      <li><strong>How do parentheses affect the arithmetic outcome of an expression?</strong></li>
      <p>
				It prioritizes it's calculation to do the parentheses firstly. Much like how you do in normal math.
			</p>
      <li><strong>How do we limit floating-point numbers to a given number of decimals?</strong></li>
      <p>
			  You can limit the number of decimals for floating-point numbers using the toFixed()
			</p>
      <li><strong>How can we compare two floating-point values to see if they are equal (is 12.199999 the same as 12.2)?</strong></li>
      <p>
				We have comparison operations that can help with finding out if something is greater than, equal too or lesser than something. 
        This is also used in normal math
			</p>
      <li><strong>What do comparison operators return, and how can we check if they are FALSE or TRUE?</strong></li>
      <p>
				They return boolean values that are either True or False. To check it you can use "if" statement or log it
			</p>
      <li><strong>How does the Math.random() function work, and what can it be used for?</strong></li>
      <p>
				You provide it with some random numbers to work with and it will give you a number between the two values you gave it.
			</p>
      <li><strong>What is modulus (%), and when do we need this operator in mathematical operations?</strong></li>
      <p>
				Let's say you divide a number, but there are still something left of this number. Like let's do 10 divided by 3.
        <br>Then the answer will be 3, as you can only divide 3 times, but that means we have 1 left from dividing. % tells you the remainder of this calculation.

        <br>Mathematically speaking this is mostly used for finding out if something is odd or even
