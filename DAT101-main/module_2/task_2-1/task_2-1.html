Question 1: Can we create variables and constants without assigning values to them? If not, why, and which
ones (variables, constants, or both)?

Answer: Both yes and no. We got "var" & "let" variables that we can create without assigning values. Reason being that they will automatically fill the blank space with
"unidentified" variable. Letting you change the variable in the future, but constant does not allow for this as that would contradict it's task of being a constant. 
Constants are suppose to hold value and not change. So by not having any values to hold onto it will give you an error.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 2: Can we create variables and constants on the same line, or must we separate them onto different
lines? If we can, how do we differentiate them?

Answer: You cannot mix let, var or const together in one line. If multiple variables is needed, then you must the same declarations. Mixing something like "const" and "let"
in one line will not work as these declarations work differently on their own.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 3. Can we assign a new value to a constant later in the code? Try to explain why we can or cannot.

Answer: No we can't since "const" is suppose to be holding it's value throughout the whole code. HOWEVER! if the value is an object or array, 
then it's contents can be modified.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 4. What happens if we create a variable without using the let or const commands? Now, add "use
strict" to the very top of your script. Describe what you observe in the browser's "Inspect"
window. You can learn more about "use strict" on W3Schools.

Answer: I get a error message saying
 "Uncaught ReferenceError: x is not defined
    at task_2-1.html:41:3"

*/

/* 
"use strict";
x = 1; 
console.log(x); 
*/

5. What are implicit and explicit variable declarations?

Answer: Implicit variable declarations are valuables that hasn't specifically been declared to anything, so if you run it in strict mode, it will most likely give you an error
as it's to help you not run using undeclared variables and helps with cleaner code.

Explicit variables avoids those global variables UNintentionally and uses var, let and const. It's good practice to always declare for cleaner code and for people to understand.

 let person = {

const age = 22;
var birthYear = 2002;

console.log(person.firstName + '' + person.lastName);
console.log("jeg er"+ " " + age + " Ã¥r gammel og fÃ¸dt i Ã¥r " + birthYear);
//Not sure if this is allowed, but instead of adding + " " I just added space inside the second string
