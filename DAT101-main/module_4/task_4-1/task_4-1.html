      <li><b>Why is object-oriented development so important in programming?</b></li>
      <p>Object-oriented development (OOD) is key because it helps you keep your code neat and organized. You can break your program into smaller pieces (objects) that are easier to manage, and you can reuse code, which makes life a lot easier when you need to scale or fix things.</p>

      <li><b>In Task 1, we create a static object called "AccountType." Explain what this object is used for and how this type of object can help us in software development.</b></li>
      <p>The AccountType object is just a way to define different account types like Normal or Saving. It helps us avoid mistakes by keeping the account types in one place, making it easier to update and keeping everything consistent across the code.</p>

      <li><b>Discuss why we use encapsulation in classes. Why do we want to "hide" code within our class? Explain how we can create "private" and "public" members in a constructor function.</b></li>
      <p>Encapsulation is all about keeping stuff organized. We hide certain details inside the class so that users only see what they need to interact with, keeping the rest safe. We can make things "private" by using underscores (like _balance) or just keep them inside the class, while "public" things are accessible from outside the class.</p>

      <li><b>Explain what happens when we use the "new" command in JavaScript.</b></li>
      <p>When you use new, you're basically telling JavaScript, "Hey, create a new instance of this thing." It runs the constructor, sets up the object with all the properties and methods, and gives you a new object to work with.</p>
